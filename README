Two programs are contained here:

Dumper: given a Transformice.swf, extracts the true .swf that is
embedded in the binary blobs inside.

Sniffer: given a true .swf, extracts the keys needed to login to the
game.

See the fetch.sh script for an example of intended usage.

COMPILING

POSIX: simply use the makefile, this assumes that zlib libraries and
headers are installed.

WINDOWS: use the `mingw-makefile` to compile instead. It will use the
`include` and `lib` folders to supply the zlib headers and
libraries. If you don't have the binaries, some are provided in the
`zlib_for_ming32.zip` file in this directory.

make all OR make sniffer OR make dumper

on windows replace `make` with `make -f mingw-makefile`
