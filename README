Two programs are contained here:

dumper: given a Transformice.swf, extracts the true .swf that is
embedded in the binary blobs inside.

sniffer: given a true .swf, extracts the keys needed to login to the
game. It will output them both to terminal and a binary file.

See the fetch.sh script for an example of intended usage.

COMPILING

POSIX: simply use the makefile, this assumes that zlib libraries and
headers are installed.

WINDOWS: use the `mingw-makefile` to compile instead. It will use the
`include` and `lib` folders to supply the zlib headers and
libraries. If you don't have the binaries, some are provided in the
`zlib_for_ming32.zip` file in this directory.

make all
- OR -
make sniffer
- OR -
make dumper

on windows replace `make` with `make -f mingw-makefile`

If during compiling on windows you recieve an error message like the
following:

In file included from ./include/zconf.h:288:0,
                 from ./include/zlib.h:36,
                 from src/swf_file.cpp:3:
c:\mingw\include\sys\types.h:75:19: error: conflicting declaration 'typedef _off_t off_t'
   typedef _off_t  off_t;


Fix it by removing the lines 34 - 35 in include/zlib.h

(these lines)

typedef size_t _fsize_t;
typedef long long off_t;
